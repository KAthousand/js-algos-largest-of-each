## Mini Algorithm Exercise

> _Title: "Largest of Each"_
>
> _Difficulty: Medium_

### Objectives

- Create a function which takes one argument– an array of arrays of integers– `arr`.
- Create a new array which takes the largest element from each array.
- The output should be an array.

_i.e.:_

``` js
// input
[
  [4, 5, 1, 3],
  [13, 27, 18, 26],
  [32, 35, 37, 39],
  [1000, 1001, 857, 1]
]

// output
[5, 27, 39, 1001]
```

#### Notes

- No `for` loops allowed.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!
